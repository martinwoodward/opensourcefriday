ðŸŒŸ Join us for #OpenSourceFriday featuring Rafael PÃ³lit from Uwazi! ðŸŒŸ 

Uwazi is an open-source application that empowers human rights defenders and changemakers to organize collections of information, revealing powerful insights and opportunities for action. Developed by the NGO HURIDOCS, Uwazi (which means "openness" in Swahili) helps make vital human rights information more accessible and impactful. Whether you're passionate about human rights, open source for good, or harnessing data to drive change, this is a can't-miss event. Bring your questions for Rafa!

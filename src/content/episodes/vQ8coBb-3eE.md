Kargo is a next-generation continuous delivery and application lifecycle orchestration platform for Kubernetes. It builds upon GitOps principles and integrates with existing technologies, like Argo CD, to streamline and automate the progressive rollout of changes across the many stages of an application's lifecycle. Kargo aims to mitigate the challenges that come with doing environment promotions using GitOps by taking a declarative approach to doing those promotions.

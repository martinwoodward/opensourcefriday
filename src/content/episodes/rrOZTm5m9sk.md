Hey folks! This #OpenSourceFriday, we've got a treat for you. We're hosting a chat with Jordan Harband, who's got a ton of experience with open source and particularly knows their way around the npm ecosystem. The hot topic? "The Cost of Breaking Changes in the npm Ecosystem and Its Impact on Open Source Sustainability."
Ever updated an npm package and then spent hours fixing unexpected issues? Yeah, we've all been there. Jordan's going to break down the why and how of these breaking changes, and more importantly, what they mean for the open source community. Expect insights on balancing innovation with stability and keeping the open source spirit alive and kicking.

ðŸš€ Join us for an exciting Open Source Friday featuring Nick Taylor, the creator of the copilot-extension-template!

Nick is a passionate advocate for Open Source, TypeScript, and serverless computing, with a knack for bringing teams together to achieve great things. In this session, Nick will walk us through the copilot-extension-template, a starter kit he designed to help developers build custom GitHub Copilot extensions. Built on Node.js using the Hono framework, this tool provides everything you need to extend Copilotâ€™s capabilities, with instructions for local server setup, creating GitHub Apps, and testing in Copilot Chat, VS Code, and Visual Studio. Donâ€™t miss this chance to learn from Nick and dive into the possibilities of extending GitHub Copilot. Weâ€™ll see you there!
